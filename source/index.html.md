On offer is this **stunning, rare manual**, late 2004 Lamborghini Murciélago 6.2 V12 LP580 4WD RHD Coupe finished in the **best combination of black/black** with contrasting white stitching and **Sportivo Seats**.

This **genuine UK car** has covered only **21,000 miles** and benefits from an up to date and **full Lamborghini service history** with an accompanying comprehensive document file, and was last serviced at Lamborghini Sevenoaks in December 2015.

The vehicle is fully HPI clear and has been part of the current owner's private collection for the last 8 years.

The valuable **private registration number is available** by separate negotiation.
