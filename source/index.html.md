We are thrilled to offer this stunning very rare 2005 Lamborghini Murcielago 6.2 V12 LP580 4WD LHD Manual Coupe finished in Nero Aldeberan with contrasting Giallo Taurus Bicolour Nappa Full Grain Sportivo Seats.

The vehicle has covered only 19,000 Miles (31,000 kilometres) and benefits from an up to date and Full Lamborghini Service History with an Accompanying Comprehensive Document File and was last serviced at Lamborghini Sevenoaks 250 miles ago.

The vehicle is fully HPI clear and the current owner has owned the vehicle since 1,500 miles and it has been part of their private collection for the last 9 years.
